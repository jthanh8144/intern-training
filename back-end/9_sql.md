## Notes

- The comment table contains comments from both Blog and News. Based on the `target_table` and `target_id` fields, `target_table` has two possible values: `blog` and `news`.
- Examples:
  - `target_table = "blog"` and `target_id = 3`: Comment of the Blog with `id = 3`
  - `target_table = "news"` and `target_id = 2`: Comment of the News with `id = 2`
- The `follow` table has two foreign keys: `from_user_id` and `to_user_id`, both `REFERENCES user(id)`.
  If user 1 follows user 2, then `from_user_id = 1` and `to_user_id = 2`.
